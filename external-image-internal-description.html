  <h1>Longdesc test:  External image, internal description</h1>
  <p>The <code>longdesc</code> attribute for the image on this page references an internal URI (same page link).  In order for the following tests to pass, the tester must verify that the focus has moved to text that reads "Pass, if the focus is here" when they access the image description (longdesc).<p>
  <img src="picture.png" alt="the image" longdesc="#pass">
<div style="height:50em"></div>
<p id="pass">Pass, if the focus is here</p>
<div style="height:50em"></div>

  <h1>Longdesc test:  Empty image, internal description</h1>
  <p>The image on this page is missing a value for the <code>src</code> attribute. The <code>longdesc</code> attribute references an internal URI (same page link). In order for the following tests to pass, the tester must verify that the focus has moved to text that reads "Pass, if the focus is here"</p>
  <img src="" alt="the image" longdesc="#pass">
<div style="height:50em"></div>
<p id="pass">Pass, if the focus is here</p>

  <h1>Longdesc test: External image, external description, relative base</h1>
  <p>This page has a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element that references a relative URI. The <code>longdesc</code> attribute for the image references an external URI.In order for the following test to pass, the tester must be able to access the "Longdesc test Pass Page" which consists of the word "Pass" in a heading level 1 followed by a long description of the image. <em>NOTE: the URI of the pass page will actually be fail.html, but the page indicates a pass - this is used to demonstrate that URIs are quite often opaque or misleading strings and should not be presented directly to the user.</em></p>
  <img src="picture2.png" alt="the image" longdesc="fail.html">
  <p>If the image is broken, the base element has not been interpreted correctly so the test result is unknowable</p>

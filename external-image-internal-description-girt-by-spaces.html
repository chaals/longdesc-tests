  <h1>Longdesc test:  External image, internal description surrounded by spaces</h1>
  <p>The <code>longdesc</code> attribute for the image on this page references an internal URI (same page link) surrounded by spaces.  In order for this test to pass, the tester must be able to access the image description (longdesc). Success is the display of the "Longdesc test Pass page" (page title) which simply consists the word "Pass" contained in a heading level 1.<p>
